# Meta-backend-capstone

In the Back-End Developer Capstone Certificate program within the Meta Backend Developer Certificate, I successfully completed a web application project. This project was developed using Django as the backend framework, showcasing my proficiency in server-side programming, database management, and web application development. The project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications while adhering to best practices in software development.

In this project I worked with two models: Booking and MenuItem. I created APIs using django rest framework to perform CRUD operations on the MenuItem and Booking models and also tested the views and models by creating dedicated test functions. I also added user authentication and authorization in this project using djoser and the key functionality urls can be found in readme.txt file in the project.
